# Individual Contributor License Agreement

> **Summary:** You keep copyright to your code. You grant IntuneGet's maintainer a broad license to use, distribute, and sublicense your contribution (including under commercial licenses). Signing is a one-time, 5-second action via a PR comment. Full legal text below.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to IntuneGet ("the Project"), maintained by Ugur Koc ("the Maintainer"). This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to the Maintainer.

By signing this Agreement (via a pull request comment as described in CONTRIBUTING.md), you accept and agree to the following terms for your present and future contributions submitted to the Project.

## 1. Definitions

"Contribution" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that you intentionally submit to the Project for inclusion. This includes any communication submitted via pull requests, issues, or other channels, but excludes communications clearly marked as "Not a Contribution."

"You" means the individual or legal entity on whose behalf a Contribution is submitted.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions and any derivative works thereof. This includes the right to sublicense these rights under any license, including proprietary licenses.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the Maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project.

## 4. You Retain Copyright

You retain ownership of the copyright in your Contribution. This Agreement does not transfer copyright ownership. You are free to use your Contribution in other projects and for any other purpose.

## 5. Representations

You represent that:

- Each Contribution is your original creation, or you have sufficient rights to grant the licenses in this Agreement.
- Your Contribution does not violate any third party's intellectual property rights.
- If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you have received permission to make the Contribution on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights for the Contribution.

## 6. No Warranty

Your Contributions are provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

## 7. Agreement

You confirm that you have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement. If you are signing on behalf of your employer, you represent that you have the necessary authority to bind that entity.
