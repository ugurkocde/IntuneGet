            Welcome, and thanks for this PR!

            To keep things moving, we just need a one-time CLA signature. It takes about 5 seconds:

            1. Read the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/CLA.md) (TL;DR: you keep your copyright, we get a license to distribute).
            2. Reply to **this comment** with the exact text below:

            > I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA

            That's it -- you'll never be asked again on future PRs.

          custom-allsigned-prcomment: "All contributors have signed the CLA. Thank you!"
